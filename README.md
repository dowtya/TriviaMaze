# TriviaMaze

TO NOTE: The master branch is where you will find the finished project.


This is a Trivia Maze assignment done for a class project in June 2021.
In this project, the user will be asked a series of questions, get one right and you can
move to the adjacent title that you attempted to get into.  Get one wrong, and
that door is forever closed.  You are free to move backwards as much as you would like
but there is only one winning tile, and if you lock off your way to get there it will 
end the game, triggering the losing screen.

ENJOY!
